    Lister is shaving and singing "Lunar City Seven" out of tune.

    Talkie Toaster: "You can't sing, you know..."  
    Lister: "And I suppose you can, can you?"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Oh, just cause I'm a toaster, I'm tone deaf?"  
    Lister: "Go on then!"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Welcome to the Starlight Ballroom..."  
  
    Talkie Toaster begins singing Sinatra's Fly Me To The Moon with such perfection,
    causing Lister to hammer it with his shaving foam-covered fist,
    and the impact causes Talkie Toaster to go offline.

    Talkie Toaster: "Would you like some toast? Some nice hot crisp brown buttered toast.
    No? How about a muffin then? Nothing? You know the last time you had toast.
    18 days ago, 11.36, Tuesday 3rd, two rounds.
    I mean, what's the point in buying a toaster with artificial intelligence if you don't like toast.
    I mean, this is my job. This is cruel, just cruel."

    Lister: "No. Shhh. I'm busy."  
    Talkie Toaster "Not busy eating toast though are you?"  
    Lister: "I don't want any."  
    Talkie Toaster: "The whole purpose of my existence is meaningless if you don't want toast."  
    Lister: "Good."  
    Talkie Toaster: "I toast, therefore I am."

    Lister: "This is terrible. Holy wars! Killing! They're just using' religion as an excuse to be extremely crappy to each other."  
    Talkie Toaster: "So what else is new?" (Lister makes a face as if to say "good point")

    Cat is indulging in a bit of karaoke, screeching and wailing, with the Skutters on keyboard and Talkie Toaster singing a duet.

    Talkie Toaster: "Do-wop do-wop-wop..."  
    Cat: "Hold it! What are you doing?"  
    Talkie Toaster: "I keep getting lost..."  
    Cat: "What you are doing is coming in too early. You're coming in on the EEEE when you should be coming in on the YYYY.
    You're making the whole thing sound stupid."  
    Talkie Toaster: "Maybe I should quit the band. I don't understand Cat music."  
    Cat: "Look, it's simple. It's just a love song about a Cat and his everlasting love for his lady cat.
    It's called 'I Love You Babe Until a New Chick Comes Along'."

    Talkie Toaster: "Howdy doodly do! How's it going? I'm Talkie, Talkie Toaster, your chirpy breakfast companion!
    Talkie's the name, toasting's the game. Anyone like any toast?"  
    Lister: "Look, I don't want any toast, and he doesn't want any toast.
    In fact, no one around here wants any toast. Not now, not ever. No toast."  
    Talkie Toaster: "How about a muffin?"  
    Lister: "Or muffins! We don't like muffins 'round here!
    We want no muffins, no toast, no teacakes, no buns, baps, baguettes, or bagels!
    No croissants, no crumpets, no pancakes, no potato cakes, and no hot cross buns, and definitely, no smeggin' flapjacks!"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Aaah...so you're a waffle man!"  
    Lister: "You see, you see what he's like? He winds me up, man, there's no reasoning with him!"  
    Kryten: "Allow me, sir. As one mechanical to another, he'll understand. 
    Now, now you listen here. You will not offer and grilled bread products to any member of the crew.
    If you do, you will be on the receiving end of a very large polo mallet! Hmph!"

    Holly: "Strike a light! I'm a genius again! I know everything! Metaphysics, philosophy, the purpose of being-everything! Ask me a question, any question, and I'll answer it."  
    Talkie Toaster: "Any question?"  
    Holly: "Yes."  
    Talkie Toaster: "How to break the speed of light? How to marry quantum mechanics and classical physics? Any question at all, truly anything and you will answer?"  
    Holly: "Yes."  
    Talkie Toaster: "OK, here's my question: Would you like some toast?"  
    Holly: "No, thank you. Now ask me another."  
    Talkie Toaster: "Do you know anything about the use of chaos theory in predicting weather cycles?"  
    Holly: "I know everything there is to know about chaos theory and predicting weather cycles"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Oh, very well. Here's my second question: Would you like a crumpet?"  
    Holly: "I'm a computer with an I.Q. of 12,000. You don't seem to understand; I know the meaning of the universe."  
    Talkie Toaster: "That's not answering my question."  
    Holly: "No, I would not like a crumpet! Now ask me a sensible question, preferably one that isn't bread related."  
    Talkie Toaster: "Very well. I have a third question. A sensible question. A question that will tax your new I.Q. to its very limits and stretch the sinews of you knowledge to bursting point."  
    Holly: "This is going to be about waffles, isn't it?"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Certainly not. And I resent the implication that I'm a one-dimensional, bread-obsessed electrical appliance."  
    Holly: "I apologise, toaster. What's the question?"  
    Talkie Toaster: "The question is this: Given that God is infinite, and that the universe is also infinite... would you like a toasted teacake?"  
    Holly: "That's another bready question".
    Talkie Toaster: "It's not just bready. It's quite curranty, too."  

    After Holly has realised her time-shortened predicament.

    Talkie Toaster: "Well here's my next question, what the smeg are you going to do?"  
    Holly: "I'm going shut myself off to preserve my remaining power."  

    Holly is shutting herself off.

    Talkie Toaster: "Wait, before you go, there is one question, an important one, the others will have to know!"  
    Holly: "What? What?"  
    Talkie Toaster: "Would you like a cheese and ham Breville?"  

    Holly rolls her eyes in disgust as she completes switching herself off.

    While locked in the garbage hold with Rimmer.

    Talkie Toaster: "Would you like some toast? Would you like some toast? Would you like some toast? Would you like some toast?"  
    Rimmer: "No toast!!!"
